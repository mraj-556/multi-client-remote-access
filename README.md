# multi-client-remote-access
This can control multiple systems as a topology connection, and you can switch over to any system as you want.

It also contains a custom shell and commands for scanning the server to fetch the clients which are currently connected to your server.

This was tested successfully on my local ,system and working fine as per my expectation
